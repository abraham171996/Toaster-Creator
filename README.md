# Toaster-Creator
The Git repository contains a project that implements a toast notification system using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Toast notifications are small, temporary messages that appear on the screen to provide feedback or alert users about certain events or actions.
The project allows users to create and customize toast notifications with different styles, durations, and options. It includes checkboxes for selecting success or error toast types, an input field for entering a custom message, and additional options such as cancelable and duration. Users can add toast notifications by clicking the "Add" button and clear all notifications by clicking the "Clear" button.

The toast notifications are dynamically created and appended to a container element. They are styled with CSS to have a specific width, height, colors, alignment, and border radius. Success and error toast notifications are differentiated with different background colors.

The project also supports cancelable toast notifications, which display a close button ("X") that allows users to dismiss them before the designated duration expires. When a toast notification is canceled, it is removed from the screen and from the internal array that keeps track of the active notifications.

The repository provides a reusable and customizable toast notification system that can be easily integrated into web applications or websites. Developers can utilize the code and styles provided to enhance user experience by providing timely and informative feedback to users through toast notifications.

Overall, this Git repository offers a convenient and flexible solution for implementing toast notifications with various options and customization possibilities. It serves as a useful resource for developers looking to incorporate toast notifications into their projects quickly and efficiently.
